<h2>Role & Responsibilities</h2>
<p><strong>Mechanical Engineer — CanSat @ Virginia Tech</strong><br>
<em>Aug 2023 – May 2024</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed, manufactured, and tested components using iterative design cycles to optimize performance.</li>
<li>Performed fabrication using laser cutting, CNC machining, 3D printing, soldering, crimping, and cable routing.</li>
<li>Helped precision-assemble probe modules, ensuring weight, tolerance, and integration requirements were met.</li>
<li>Probe survived thermal testing and impact from over <strong>3500 ft</strong> while staying below the <strong>0.9 kg mass limit</strong>.</li>
<li>Team placed <strong>38th of 100+ teams worldwide</strong> at the NASA & Lockheed Martin–sponsored AAS CanSat competition.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Design Overview</h2>
<p>The payload was modeled in SolidWorks as a fully modular system, allowing rapid replacement and testing of nosecone, burn-wire deployment, electronics, and carbon‑fiber structural modules. The design emphasized low mass, high strength, and manufacturability.</p>


<h2>Key Subsystems</h2>
<h3>1. Carbon Fiber Nosecone & Structural Modules</h3>
<p>Used custom 3D‑printed molds and vacuum bagging to manufacture carbon‑fiber components. This significantly reduced weight while maintaining strength and heat resistance.</p>


<h3>2. Burn‑Wire Deployment Mechanism</h3>
<p>Designed and integrated a two‑stage MOSFET + capacitor switching system enabling reliable deployment at low voltages (3.3–12V). Tuned for rapid aerobrake release.</p>


<h3>3. PCB‑Based Flight Computer</h3>
<p>Transitioned from protoboard to a custom 2‑layer PCB, improving vibration resistance and reducing mass. Iterated routing for improved sensor spacing, shorter traces, and better thermal behavior.</p>


<h2>Reports & Documentation</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="../assets/docs/Cansat_Final_PDR_Draft.pdf" download>Preliminary Design Report (PDR) — PDF</a></li>
<li><a href="../assets/docs/CanSat_2024_Spring_UGR_Submission.pdf" download>UGR Submission Report — PDF</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>The final probe met all competition constraints, survived real‑world thermal and high‑energy impact testing, and performed reliably during launch weekend. The team achieved a top‑40 global ranking among collegiate aerospace teams.</p>
